# dd2432-labs
⚠️ **Dear KTH ANN students... I noticed a peak in the traffic (probably due to the course running now in Period 3). We released our work freely as we believe knowledge is there to be shared. However, you should try to implement the labs by yourself. Do remember the [KTH Code of Honor](https://www.kth.se/en/csc/utbildning/hederskodex/inledning-1.17237)**

⭐️ **Finally, if our work helps you out, please consider starring it.**
